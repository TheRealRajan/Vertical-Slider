# Vertical-Slider
A visually pleasing vertical image slider where the image and description text slide opposite to each other in the vertical direction with a subtle transition effect.<br><br>
When you click on the up or down buttons ⬆ / ⬇ , the image will switch along with the text description but in the opposite vertical diection. This image switch is accompanied by a subtle CSS transition effect to make it less jarring and more visually pleasing.<br><br>
The demo is live at *https://therealrajan.github.io/Vertical-Slider/* <br><br>
The site isnt optimized for *portrait mode*, so please view it in **landscape mode** for best effect.<br><br>
